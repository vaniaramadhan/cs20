    <p> my favorite place is Portsmouth, NH. I visited often when I was 
        living/growing up in New Hampshire and when I visit friends/family from 
        my hometown, we plan to go to Portsmouth. </p>

    <span> My favorite restaurant is
    <a href="https://www.hongkongeaterytogo.com/" target="_blank"> Hong Kong Eatery!</a>
    <p>Something that no one would expect about me is that I actually like doing things alone and having quiet time.</p>
